# Linked Events in brief

Enter your event details once and they can be used in various places. 

Linked Events is an event database based on open source code. It is not an event calendar in itself but instead it provides event details for different apps – also others than City of Turku apps. In other words, the events don’t have to be organised by the City of Turku.

Linked Events event database

When you enter data carefully, it will be easier to find the event and use the data in different apps.

-----

### A. General information

<br>

1. **Linked Events is an event database of the City of Turku**. 
The events that have been entered in the service are automatically transferred to the City of Turku events calendar, other websites and calendar apps maintained by others than the City of Turku. Therefore, it is good to create an event description that is easily understood in various locations of use.

2. **The form for notifying events** can be found at **https://testilinkedevents.turku.fi/**. You will receive access rights by first logging into the service and then sending a request to confirm access rights. The form can be used anywhere, also with mobile devices. You have the right to edit events of your own organisation.

3. **The City of Turku enables entering events in the database**. 
The events don’t need to be organised by the City of Turku and they don’t need to be open to all but any restrictions must be clearly stated in the event description.

4. In the service, you can a) **search among all city events**, b) **browse, edit and delete events of your own organisation** and c) **add new events**. If the event is recurring, you can add all dates at once.

### B. Adding an event

<br>

5. **Add a new event**: you can enter the event details in Finnish, Swedish and English. It is good to enter the information in several languages particularly in the case of big events and events suitable for language target groups.

 5.1 **Fill in the data as comprehensively and specifically as possible**. The instruction texts in the form provide guidance.

 5.2 **Add an image whenever possible**. See more specific instructions below.

 5.3 **You can select a recurring event that takes place on several days**. To add a recurring event, select “Add new occasion”. For a regularly recurring event, use the “Recurring event” tool. If the event has several dates, an umbrella event will automatically be created for it.

 5.4 **The location of the event is selected from among places in the register of City of Turku units**. The address information is fetched automatically when the correct location is found. You can specify instructions for arrival in the additional information field.

 5.5 **Categorising the event using key words is important so that users of different apps find the event**. Pick a few keywords and favour words that have been used for several events. Keywords (see General Finnish Ontology YSO **https://finto.fi/yso/en**) can most often be found in plural form, e.g. books, families, plays and paintings.

 5.6 **Main categories and target groups are primarily set for the turku.fi** site, but they may also be used in other event apps.

 5.7 **Saving may take a while if the event has several dates**. Wait a moment after selecting “Publish event”, and the form should then proceed to the next view. If you receive an error message, check the erroneous fields.

 5.8 **You can also use a past event as a basis for a new event**. You can do this by opening the past event and selecting “Copy to draft”. You can see your own events in “Manage events”.

### C. Error situations and suggestions

<br>

6. In error situations, you can send a message through the exclamation mark icon on the left side of the form. If you have suggestions for improvement or need advice, please contact  **driveturku@turku.fi**.


### D. Adding images into the interface

<br>

**Before putting an image online, edit it to create a suitable horizontal image**. The aspect ratio is 3:2, for instance 1200 x 800 px. The maximum file size is 2 MB. However, keep the file size as small as possible, taking into consideration mobile use. The accepted file format include jpeg, gif and png.

Alt text, i.e. verbal description of image content

Alt text, i.e. an alternative text for an image, is a verbal description of the image for persons who cannot, for one reason or another, see the image itself. The alt text is an obligatory field.

In the alt text, briefly describe the content of the image, for instance ”Children playing outside a day care centre”. Please note that an alt text is not a caption. **In other words, you cannot state things in an alt text that are not directly visible in the image.**

**Using an alt text is obligatory due to the EU-wide directive on accessibility.**.

### Caption and photographer

<br>

In the caption, you can very briefly provide further information on the image and the event. The photographer field is obligatory. If the photographer is not known, you can indicate the right holder of the image in the field. The photographer information is obligatory due to licences.

### Licence

<br>

**Always make sure that you or the organisation you represent have the right to use the image for marketing the event**. Confirming the right to use the image is always the responsibility of the person entering the image into the interface.
Also selecting the correct licence falls under the responsibility of the user.


CC 4.0 BY = the image can be shared and used freely, as long as author information is included (see further information at **https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/**)
Image may be used only for this event = the image can be used and shared only in connection with the event information.

Unless agreed otherwise with the photographer or right holder of the image, select the licence "Image may be used only for this event" for the image.

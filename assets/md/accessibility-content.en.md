We work continuously to improve the web accessibility of the digital services

We work on improving the web accessibility of the digital services

The expertise and knowhow of the personnel regarding the web accessibility is being developed systematically and purposefully by the City of Turku. The contract vendors regarding the web accessibility will evaluate the current digital services of the City of Turku. 

Based on the evaluation, the web accessibility of the digital services will be developed to the level required by the law by the deadline stated for each service. The web accessibility will be considered from the outset in the development and acquisition of new online services. Training in web accessibility is organised for all parties involved in the development of online services and in the production of their content.

The City of Turku is working on a project to meet the requirements set by the Finnish Act on the provision of digital services (Saavutettavuuslaki).
